## Brief Description

This project was developed using reactJS on the frontend and firebase as the backend.

It makes use of hte firebase cloud storage and functions.

Firebase functions was used in sending emails both to the database and to my personal email.

At the frontend, the CSS grid and flex properties were extensively used to ensure responsiveness and mobile-friendliness.

The app is given a no-refresh effect, thanks to the react-router-dom. 

Also, since firebase offers real-time data access, events occuring in the backend is fired off to the frontend in realtime.
